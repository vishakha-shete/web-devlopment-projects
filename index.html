            <p>The <b>blockchain</b> is a mar
        </b><mark> distributed ledger </mark> with growing lists of records <del>(blocks)</del> blinks that are securely
        linked together
        via cryptographic hashes.<sup>[1][2][3][4]</sup> Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block,
        a
        timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by
        leaves). Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare
        linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain
        transactions are resistant to alteration because, once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be changed
        retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks and obtaining network consensus to accept these changes.

    Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network for use as a public distributed
    ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new transaction
    blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks are possible, blockchains may be
    considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.[5]

    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation "Computer Systems
        Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups".<sup>[10][11]</sup> Further work on a
        cryptographically
        secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.<sup>[4][12]</sup> They
        wanted to
        implement a system wherein document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave
        Bayer incorporated Merkle trees into the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document
        certificates to be collected into one block.<sup>[4][13]</sup> Under their company Surety, their document
        certificate
        hashes have been published in The New York Times every week since 1995.[14]</p>
    <h2>Structure and design</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and often public, digital ledger consisting of records called
        blocks that are used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved block cannot be altered
        retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.<sup>[3][21]</sup> This allows the participants
        to verify
        and audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively.<sup>[22]</sup> A blockchain database is
        managed
        autonomously using a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server. They are authenticated by mass
        collaboration powered by collective self-interests.<sup>[23]</sup> Such a design facilitates robust workflow
        where
        participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the
        characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was
        transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double-spending. A blockchain has been described as
        a value-exchange protocol.<sup>[24]</sup> A blockchain can maintain title rights because, when properly set up
        to detail
        the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels offer and acceptance.[citation needed]

    <pre>Logically, a blockchain can be seen as consisting of several layers:[25]</pre>
    <li> infrastructure (hardware)</li>
    <li>networking (node discovery, information propagation[26] and verification)</li>
    <li>consensus (proof of work, proof of stake)</li>
    <li>data (blocks, transactions)</li>
    <li>application (smart contracts/decentralized applications, if applicable)</li>
    </p>
    <b>
        <h2>Blocks</h2>
    </b>
    <p>
        Blocks hold batches of valid transactions that are hashed and encoded into a Merkle tree.<sup>[3] </sup>Each
        block includes
        the cryptographic hash of the prior block in the blockchain, linking the two. The linked blocks form a
        chain.<sup>[3]</sup>
        This iterative process confirms the integrity of the previous block, all the way back to the initial block,
        which is known as the genesis block (Block 0).<sup>[27]</sup> To assure the integrity of a block and the data
        contained in
        it, the block is usually digitally signed.<sup>[28]</sup><br><br>

        Sometimes separate blocks can be produced concurrently, creating a temporary fork. In addition to a secure
        hash-based history, any blockchain has a specified algorithm for scoring different versions of the history so
        that one with a higher score can be selected over others. Blocks not selected for inclusion in the chain are
        called orphan blocks.[27] Peers supporting the database have different versions of the history from time to
        time. They keep only the highest-scoring version of the database known to them. Whenever a peer receives a
        higher-scoring version (usually the old version with a single new block added) they extend or overwrite their
        own database and retransmit the improvement to their peers. There is never an absolute guarantee that any
        particular entry will remain in the best version of history forever. Blockchains are typically built to add the
        score of new blocks onto old blocks and are given incentives to extend with new blocks rather than overwrite old
        blocks. Therefore, the probability of an entry becoming superseded decreases exponentially[29] as more blocks
        are built on top of it, eventually becoming very low.<sup>[3][30]: ch. 08 [31]</sup> For example, bitcoin uses a
        proof-of-work system, where the chain with the most cumulative proof-of-work is considered the valid one by the
        network. There are a number of methods that can be used to demonstrate a sufficient level of computation. Within
        a blockchain the computation is carried out redundantly rather than in the traditional segregated and parallel
        manner
    </p>

    <h2> Block time</h2>
    <p>The block time is the average time it takes for the network to generate one extra block in the blockchain. By the
        time of block completion, the included data becomes verifiable. In cryptocurrency, this is practically when the
        transaction takes place, so a shorter block time means faster transactions. The block time for Ethereum is set
        to between 14 and 15 seconds, while for bitcoin it is on average 10 minutes.[33]</p>

    <h2>Hard forks</h2>
    <p>This section is an excerpt from Fork (blockchain) § Hard fork.[edit] <br><br>
        A hard fork is a change to the blockchain protocol that is not backward compatible and requires all users to
        upgrade their software in order to continue participating in the network. In a hard fork, the network splits
        into two separate versions: one that follows the new rules and one that follows the old rules. <br><br>

        For example, Ethereum was hard forked in 2016 to "make whole" the investors in The DAO, which had been hacked by
        exploiting a vulnerability in its code. In this case, the fork resulted in a split creating Ethereum and
        Ethereum Classic chains. In 2014 the Nxt community was asked to consider a hard fork that would have led to a
        rollback of the blockchain records to mitigate the effects of a theft of 50 million NXT from a major
        cryptocurrency exchange. The hard fork proposal was rejected, and some of the funds were recovered after
        negotiations and ransom payment. Alternatively, to prevent a permanent split, a majority of nodes using the new
        software may return to the old rules, as was the case of bitcoin split on 12 March 2013.[34] <br><br>

        A more recent hard-fork example is of Bitcoin in 2017, which resulted in a split creating Bitcoin Cash.[35] The
        network split was mainly due to a disagreement in how to increase the transactions per second to accommodate for
        demand</p>
   <h2> Decentralization</h2>
    <p>By storing data across its peer-to-peer network, the blockchain eliminates some risks that come with data being held
    centrally.[3] The decentralized blockchain may use ad hoc message passing and distributed networking.[37]<br>

    In a so-called "51% attack" a central entity gains control of more than half of a network and can then manipulate
    that specific blockchain record at will, allowing double-spending.[38] <br>

    Blockchain security methods include the use of public-key cryptography.[39]: 5  A public key (a long, random-looking
    string of numbers) is an address on the blockchain. Value tokens sent across the network are recorded as belonging
    to that address. A private key is like a password that gives its owner access to their digital assets or the means
    to otherwise interact with the various capabilities that blockchains now support. Data stored on the blockchain is
    generally considered incorruptible.[3] <br>

    Every node in a decentralized system has a copy of the blockchain. Data quality is maintained by massive database
    replication[40] and computational trust. No centralized "official" copy exists and no user is "trusted" more than
    any other.[39] Transactions are broadcast to the network using the software. Messages are delivered on a best-effort
    basis. Early blockchains rely on energy-intensive mining nodes to validate transactions,[27] add them to the block
    they are building, and then broadcast the completed block to other nodes.[30]: ch. 08  Blockchains use various
    time-stamping schemes, such as proof-of-work, to serialize changes.[41] Later consensus methods include proof of
    stake.[27] The growth of a decentralized blockchain is accompanied by the risk of centralization because the
    computer resources required to process larger amounts of data become more expensive</p>
